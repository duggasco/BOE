4. Test multi-table queries with QueryBuilder V2

## [0.41.0] - 2025-08-08

### Phase 4 Security Hardening & Export System Refactoring

#### Major Security Fixes (CRITICAL)
Successfully addressed all critical security vulnerabilities in the export system:

**Path Traversal Vulnerability Fixed**:
- **Issue**: Export downloads allowed path traversal via manipulated file paths
- **Solution**: 
  - Store only filenames in database, never full paths
  - Validate all file paths are within EXPORT_DIR using `Path.resolve()`
  - Generate secure filenames using `secrets.token_urlsafe()`
  - Implement strict path validation in `validate_file_path()` method

**Rate Limiting Implementation**:
- Added SlowAPI rate limiting (10 exports/hour per user)
- User-specific rate checking in database
- Configuration moved to settings for easy adjustment
- 429 status code returned when limit exceeded

**Automatic Cleanup Mechanism**:
- Added `expires_at` field to Export model
- Exports automatically expire after 24 hours (configurable)
- Cleanup task runs hourly via Celery
- Manual cleanup endpoint for admins

#### Architecture Improvements (Based on Gemini AI Review)

**ExportService Created**:
- Refactored all business logic into `ExportService` class
- Clean separation of concerns between router and service
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Methods for secure file handling, rate limiting, and cleanup

**Configuration Management**:
- Moved hardcoded values to `settings.py`:
  - `EXPORT_MAX_RATE_PER_HOUR`
  - `EXPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE`
  - `EXPORT_EXPIRY_HOURS`
  - `EXPORT_SECURE_HEADERS`
  - `EXPORT_STORAGE_PATH`

**Router Refactoring**:
- Simplified router to handle only HTTP concerns
- Proper URL generation using `request.url_for()`
- Better error handling with specific status codes
- Consistent response formatting

**Security Headers**:
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
- Optional `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- Optional `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`
