### Phase 4 Progress Update - Query Execution Review

#### Infrastructure Review
- Reviewed existing query execution backend (`/api/query.py`)
- Found QueryExecutor class with execute, preview, validate endpoints
- Discovered WebSocket streaming support for real-time data
- Identified critical issues in QueryBuilder service

#### Issues Identified
**QueryBuilder Problems**:
- Mixing sync/async operations incorrectly (line 129-131)
- No proper JOIN implementation despite FieldRelationship model
- Field filtering uses placeholder names instead of actual field references
- SQL injection risks in filter building

**Export System Gaps**:
- Celery tasks exist for CSV/Excel/PDF generation
- Missing download endpoints for generated files
- Need file streaming implementation for large exports

#### Next Steps
1. Fix async/await issues in QueryBuilder
2. Implement proper JOIN logic using FieldRelationship
3. Create export download endpoints with streaming
4. Connect frontend ReportBuilder to query execution
5. Add proper SQL injection prevention
