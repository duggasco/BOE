### Added
- **Centralized RBACService**: Single source of truth for all role and permission resolution
- **Group-based role resolution**: Fixed critical bug where roles assigned through groups weren't being recognized
- **Enhanced /auth/me endpoint**: Now returns complete user info with roles, groups, and permissions

- ✅ Report Viewer: Can only access 8 unrestricted fields
- ✅ Field selector correctly shows/hides fields based on user role
- ✅ Authentication flow working with all three demo accounts

### Gemini AI Collaboration
- Identified critical bug in original `/auth/me` implementation
- Suggested centralized service pattern to eliminate code duplication
- Recommended dependency injection for better FastAPI integration
- Approved final implementation as "robust, performant, and maintainable"

### Security Verification
- All RBAC filtering happens at database level (not in application code)
- User must have ALL required permissions (AND logic, not OR)
- Fields are secure-by-default (is_restricted=True)
- No N+1 queries with proper eager loading

## [0.47.0] - 2025-08-08

### Phase 4 COMPLETE - Production-Ready Field-Level RBAC

#### Critical Security Fixes
- ✅ **FIXED**: PostgreSQL JSON comparison error using JSONB cast and proper operators
- ✅ **FIXED**: Implemented ALL permissions logic (was incorrectly checking ANY)
- ✅ **FIXED**: API endpoint secure-by-default parameter (was incorrectly defaulting to False)

#### Security Implementation (Gemini-Approved)
- **Database-Level Filtering**: All RBAC filtering happens at database level
- **AND Logic**: User must have ALL required permissions (superset check)
- **Secure-by-Default**: Fields are restricted by default (is_restricted=True)
- **No N+1 Queries**: Efficient permission checking with single query
- **Production-Ready**: Gemini AI reviewed and approved as "production-ready"

#### Testing Completed
- ✅ Python script testing of secure RBAC implementation

## [0.46.0] - 2025-08-08

### Phase 4 Secure Field-Level RBAC Implementation (97% Complete)

#### Security Fixes Implemented
Successfully fixed ALL critical security vulnerabilities identified by Gemini:

**Security Improvements**:
- ✅ **FIXED**: All RBAC filtering now happens at database level (no post-query filtering)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Implemented AND logic for role + permission checks (not OR)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Secure-by-default - is_restricted defaults to True
- ✅ **FIXED**: SQL injection prevention with proper validation
- ✅ **FIXED**: Efficient permission checking without N+1 queries

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `SecureFieldService` replacing insecure implementation
- Updated Field model with secure defaults (is_restricted=True, nullable=False)
- Applied migration to safely update existing fields
- API endpoints now use secure service

**Testing Results**:
- Administrator: Access to all 11 fields ✓
- Report Creator: Should access 10 fields (issue with permissions)
- Report Viewer: Access to 8 unrestricted fields only ✓
- SQL injection attempts blocked successfully ✓

**Remaining Issue**:
- PostgreSQL JSON comparison error when checking permissions
- Need to fix: `operator does not exist: json = json`

## [0.45.0] - 2025-08-08

### Phase 4 Field-Level RBAC Implementation (95% Complete)

#### Field-Level Access Control Added
Successfully implemented field-level RBAC with security settings on the Field model:

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Added security columns to Field model: is_restricted, required_role, required_permissions
- ✅ Created FieldService with role-based access control methods
- ✅ Field access statistics endpoint for monitoring
- ✅ Security update endpoint for administrators
- ✅ Testing verified with different user roles

**Testing Results**:
- Administrator: Access to all 11 fields (including 3 restricted)
- Report Creator: Access to 8 unrestricted fields
- Report Viewer: Access to 8 unrestricted fields
- AUM field restricted to Administrator role only
- NAV and YTD Return restricted to Report Creator role

**Critical Security Issues Identified (Gemini Review)**:
- **CRITICAL**: Post-query filtering is a security bypass - all RBAC must happen at database level
- **CRITICAL**: OR logic for permissions instead of AND - allows access with partial requirements
- **HIGH**: Insecure default - fields are unrestricted by default (should be secure-by-default)
- **MEDIUM**: N+1 queries for roles and permissions impact performance
- **LOW**: String-based role storage prone to typos and inconsistencies

**Gemini Assessment**: "The most critical issues are the security vulnerability due to post-query filtering and the incorrect OR logic for RBAC conditions. These must be addressed immediately."

### Fixed
- Report parameters changed from list to dict format in database
- Frontend API URL updated to correct port (8001)
- Field security settings properly stored and retrieved

### Testing
- Field-level RBAC tested with multiple user roles
- Frontend-backend integration verified with Playwright MCP
- Reports loading successfully from backend API

- Configuration moved to settings for easy adjustment
- 429 status code returned when limit exceeded

**Automatic Cleanup Mechanism**:
- Added `expires_at` field to Export model

- Clean separation of concerns between router and service
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Methods for secure file handling, rate limiting, and cleanup

**Configuration Management**:
- Moved hardcoded values to `settings.py`:
  - `EXPORT_MAX_RATE_PER_HOUR`
  - `EXPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE`
  - `EXPORT_EXPIRY_HOURS`
  - `EXPORT_SECURE_HEADERS`
  - `EXPORT_STORAGE_PATH`

**Router Refactoring**:
- Simplified router to handle only HTTP concerns
- Proper URL generation using `request.url_for()`
