## [0.18.0] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Export Dialog Rendering Issue

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Export Dialog component wasn't rendering despite Redux state correctly updating (isOpen: true)
- Issue was caused by DndContext interfering with Ant Design Modal's portal rendering
- Modal components use React portals to render at the end of the body element

#### Solution Implementation
- Moved `<ExportDialog />` component outside of `<DndContext>` wrapper
- Removed conditional rendering (`{exportDialogOpen && <ExportDialog />}`)
- Let Modal component handle its own visibility based on the `open` prop
- Verified fix with test modal that rendered correctly

#### Technical Details
- DndContext creates a new stacking context that can interfere with fixed-position elements
- Ant Design Modals require proper portal rendering outside of drag-and-drop contexts
- Test modal confirmed that Modal components work when placed correctly

## [0.14.0] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Multi-Field Drag-Drop to Sections (CRITICAL)

#### The Problem
- Fields could only be dragged to create new sections
- Dragging fields to existing sections didn't work
- Canvas was capturing all drop events instead of individual sections

#### The Solution
1. **Canvas Drop Zone Fix**: Disabled canvas as drop target when sections exist
2. **Query Execution Fix**: Build updated query with new field before executing
3. **Duplicate Field Prevention**: Check if field already exists before adding

#### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Disable canvas drops when sections exist
const { setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({
  id: 'report-canvas',
  data: { type: 'canvas', acceptsFields: true },
  disabled: sections.length > 0, // KEY FIX
});

// Build updated query with new field
const updatedQuery = {
  ...section.dataQuery,
  [fieldTarget]: fieldExists 
    ? existingFields 
    : [...existingFields, field]
};
```

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Can now drag multiple fields to existing sections
- ✅ Fields appear as tags with remove buttons
- ✅ AG-Grid table shows all columns with proper formatting
- ✅ Currency and percentage formatting preserved
- ✅ No duplicate fields added
