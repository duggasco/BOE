# Changelog

All notable changes to the BOE Replacement System will be documented in this file.

## [0.29.0] - 2025-08-08 (Latest)

### Changed - Backend Architecture Decision

#### Pivoted to FastAPI for Entire Backend
Made strategic decision to use FastAPI instead of Node.js + Express for the backend:

**Rationale:**
- **Single Language Backend**: Python throughout reduces complexity
- **Better Developer Experience**: Automatic API docs, type validation with Pydantic
- **Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks
- **Consistency**: Shared models and utilities across all services
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type checking with Pydantic models

**New Architecture:**
```
Frontend (React) 
    ↓
FastAPI Gateway
    ├── Auth Service (FastAPI + JWT)
    ├── Query Service (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)  
    ├── Export Service (FastAPI + Celery)
    ├── Schedule Service (FastAPI + Celery)
    └── Report Service (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Built-in request/response validation
- Dependency injection for auth/database
- Async/await support throughout
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Can start as modular monolith, split to microservices later

**Updated Phase 3 Plans:**
- All backend services will use FastAPI
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy with async support
- Alembic for database migrations
- Celery for background tasks
- Redis for caching and message queue

## [0.28.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added - Native Deployment Support (Phase 2.5)

#### Intelligent Deployment System
Implemented a sophisticated deployment system that works without sudo or apt access:

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Detection**: Scripts intelligently detect available deployment methods (Docker → Native Node.js)
- **No Sudo Required**: Everything runs in user space - no system-level permissions needed
- **Local Node.js Installation**: Can download and install Node.js locally to `$HOME/.local/node` if not available
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Unix-like systems
- **User-Friendly**: Colorful output, clear error messages, and helpful prompts

**Scripts Created:**
1. **start.sh**: Intelligent startup script with multiple deployment options
   - Auto-detects Docker availability (including rootless Docker)
   - Falls back to native Node.js if Docker unavailable
   - Can install Node.js locally without sudo if needed
   - Supports `--docker`, `--native`, and `--production` flags
   - Provides clear feedback and actionable error messages

2. **stop.sh**: Safe shutdown script
   - Stops Docker containers or native Node.js processes
   - Uses PID files and port detection for accurate process management
   - Prompts before killing processes to prevent accidental shutdowns
   - Optional log file cleanup

**Security Improvements (Based on Gemini AI Review):**
- Added confirmation prompts before replacing existing Node.js installations
- Warning about NVM installation security considerations
- Improved process detection to avoid killing unrelated processes
- Docker operations now target only the frontend service
- Better error handling for build failures in production mode

**Configuration Files:**
- Added `.nvmrc` files specifying Node.js version 20
- Updated `package.json` with deployment scripts:
  - `npm start`: Intelligent auto-detection
  - `npm run start:docker`: Force Docker deployment
  - `npm run start:native`: Force native deployment
  - `npm run start:production`: Production build and serve
  - `npm run stop`: Stop the application
  - `npm run audit:security`: Security audit

**Testing:**
- Successfully tested with Playwright MCP
- Verified both Docker and native Node.js deployments work correctly
- Confirmed scripts work without sudo access
- Tested stop/start cycles and port management

## [0.27.0] - 2025-08-07 (Latest)

### Fixed - Export Dialog Functionality

#### Successfully Resolved Export Dialog Issue
Fixed issue where clicking the Export button in Report Builder did nothing:

**Issue Identified:**
- Two conflicting ExportDialog components existed in the codebase
- `ExportDialog.tsx` (old standalone component) was being imported instead of `ExportDialog/index.tsx` (Redux-integrated)
- The old component wasn't connected to Redux store, so it couldn't respond to state changes

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed the conflicting `ExportDialog.tsx` file
- Import now correctly resolves to `ExportDialog/index.tsx`
- Export dialog now properly opens with all features (format selection, destination, scheduling, prompts)

### Improved - Docker Setup Simplified

#### Streamlined Container Architecture
Simplified Docker setup to run only the frontend application:

**Changes Made:**
- Removed unnecessary backend, postgres, redis, and pgadmin services from docker-compose.yml
- Application now runs in a single container (boe-frontend)
- Cleaner, simpler deployment with just the required frontend service

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed all services except frontend
- `frontend/src/components/ReportBuilder/ExportDialog.tsx` - Deleted (conflicting file)

## [0.26.2] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Tutorial Step Transition Issue

#### Successfully Resolved Tutorial Navigation
Fixed issue where tutorial disappeared when transitioning between steps on the same page:

**Issue Identified:**
- Tutorial successfully navigates from Step 1 (body) to Step 2 (after route change)
- Tutorial was disappearing when clicking Next from Step 2 to Step 3
- Element with `data-tour="field-selector"` exists and is visible in DOM
- Issue was with Joyride needing time for DOM to settle after Ant Design components animate

**Solution Implemented (with Gemini AI collaboration):**
- Added 150ms delay for same-page transitions to allow DOM/animations to settle
- Manually pause tour, wait, then advance step and resume
- Keeps tour state intact during the transition

**Code Change:**
```tsx
} else if (walkthroughState.run) {
  // For same-page transitions, manually pause, wait, and advance
  dispatch({ type: 'PAUSE_TOUR' });
  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'GO_TO_STEP', stepIndex: nextStepIndex });
    dispatch({ type: 'RESUME_TOUR' });
  }, 150); // Small delay to let DOM settle
}
```

**Testing Results (via Playwright MCP):**
- All 9 steps of Quick Feature Tour now work correctly
- Smooth transitions between all steps
- No more disappearing tutorial dialogs
- Tutorial maintains proper state throughout

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/common/InteractiveWalkthrough.tsx` - Added delay for DOM settling

## [0.26.0] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Interactive Tutorial Navigation

#### Tutorial Walkthrough System Fix
Successfully debugged and fixed the interactive tutorial system that was stuck on initial menu:

**Issue Identified:**
- Tutorial showed only "Skip Tutorial" and "Close" buttons with no "Next" option
- Users couldn't advance beyond the first step
- Multi-page navigation was broken due to Joyride configuration

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed Joyride `continuous` prop from `false` to `true` to enable Next button
- Added proper locale configuration for step-specific button labels
- Ensured proper button state management for multi-step tours

**Testing Results (via Playwright MCP):**
- Tutorial now properly shows "Next (Step X of 9)" buttons
- Successfully navigates between routes (/reports to /reports/new)
- All 9 steps of Quick Feature Tour accessible
- Previous/Next navigation working correctly
- Progress indicator showing current step

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/common/InteractiveWalkthrough.tsx` - Fixed Joyride configuration

## [0.14.0] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Multi-Field Drag-Drop to Sections (CRITICAL)

#### The Problem
- Fields could only be dragged to create new sections
- Dragging fields to existing sections didn't work
- Canvas was capturing all drop events instead of individual sections

#### The Solution
1. **Canvas Drop Zone Fix**: Disabled canvas as drop target when sections exist
2. **Query Execution Fix**: Build updated query with new field before executing
3. **Duplicate Field Prevention**: Check if field already exists before adding

#### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Disable canvas drops when sections exist
const { setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({
  id: 'report-canvas',
  data: { type: 'canvas', acceptsFields: true },
  disabled: sections.length > 0, // KEY FIX
});

// Build updated query with new field
const updatedQuery = {
  ...section.dataQuery,
  [fieldTarget]: fieldExists 
    ? existingFields 
    : [...existingFields, field]
};
```

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Can now drag multiple fields to existing sections
- ✅ Fields appear as tags with remove buttons
- ✅ AG-Grid table shows all columns with proper formatting
- ✅ Currency and percentage formatting preserved
- ✅ No duplicate fields added

- No conversion needed - it was the correct UX pattern all along

## [0.13.0] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed - Properties Panel Redux Integration (Quick Win)

#### Properties Panel Fully Wired
- **Connected to Redux**: All form controls now properly dispatch updateSection actions
- **Controlled Components**: All inputs use Redux state as source of truth
- **Debounced Text Inputs**: 500ms debounce for text/textarea fields to prevent excessive dispatches
- **Comprehensive Section Support**:
  - **Table**: Rows per page, show row numbers, enable sorting/filtering
  - **Chart**: Chart type, title, legend, data labels, stacking, x-axis rotation
  - **Text**: Content editor with markdown support, font size
  - **Container**: Background color, padding
  - **Layout**: Width/height grid controls for all sections

#### Implementation Details
- Used lodash debounce for optimal performance
- Local state for text inputs with debounced Redux updates
- Immediate updates for toggles/dropdowns
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- Clean separation between immediate and debounced updates

#### Collaboration with Gemini
- Critically evaluated multi-field drag complexity vs MVP needs
