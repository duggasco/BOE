# Business Objects Replacement - Context Carryover

## Session Summary (2025-08-07) - LATEST

### 🎯 MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS

#### 1. Multi-Field Drag-Drop Enhancement (v0.15.0) ✅
**ENHANCEMENT**: Added checkbox selection for batch field operations

**Implementation**:
- Added checkboxes to all fields in FieldSelector tree
- Created MultiFieldDraggable component for 2+ selected fields
- Shows "Drag X selected fields together" with field previews
- Batch operations with single query execution

**Key Code Locations**:
```javascript
// frontend/src/components/ReportBuilder/FieldSelector.tsx
- Added selectedFields state (Set<string>)
- DraggableField component with checkbox support
- MultiFieldDraggable component for batch drag

// frontend/src/pages/ReportBuilder/index.tsx
- Updated handleDragEnd to support isMultiple flag
- Batch field processing with deduplication
- Single query execution for all fields
```

**Tested**: Successfully dragged 3 fields (Fund Name, Fund Code, Total Assets) together

#### 2. Properties Panel Decision ✅
- User requested dropdown implementation
- Consulted with Gemini AI for critical review
- **Decision**: Keep as collapsible drawer (current implementation)
- **Rationale**: Dropdowns unsuitable for complex forms with multiple inputs
- **Current**: 400px drawer toggled by Properties button - best UX practice

#### 3. Strategic Pivot: Table-Focused MVP ✅
- **Charts deprioritized to Phase 2**
- AG-Grid provides sufficient functionality for Phase 1
- ChartRenderer component exists but inactive
- Updated all documentation (PLAN.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Phase 1 Status**: 85% complete (was 95% with charts)

#### 4. GitHub Repository Initialized ✅
- Repository: git@github.com:duggasco/BOE.git
- Initial commit with complete Phase 1 codebase
- Branch: main
- All documentation and code pushed successfully

### ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

#### Multi-Field Drag Data Structure
```typescript
// Drag data for multi-field operations
{
  multipleFields: Field[],
  isMultiple: true
}

// Single field drag (backward compatible)
{
  fieldId: string,
  displayName: string,
  // ... other field properties
}
```

#### Canvas Drop Zone Fix (KEEP THIS!)
```javascript
// ReportCanvas.tsx - Line 325
const { setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({
  id: 'report-canvas',
  disabled: sections.length > 0, // CRITICAL: Prevents canvas from stealing drops
});
```

### 📊 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

**Phase 1: Frontend with Mock Data (Table-Focused)**
- 85% Complete
- Multi-field drag-drop ✅
- Properties panel (drawer) ✅
- AG-Grid tables ✅
- Export UI (needs wiring) 🔄
- Charts (deprioritized) ⏸️

**Remaining Work (15%)**:
1. Export dialog integration with toolbar button
2. Basic scheduling UI connection
3. Demo scenarios documentation

### 🔧 ENVIRONMENT STATUS

```bash
# Docker container running
boe-frontend (Up 7+ hours at session end)

# Access points
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Hot reload: Active

# Key files modified this session
frontend/src/components/ReportBuilder/FieldSelector.tsx
frontend/src/pages/ReportBuilder/index.tsx
PLAN.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTEXT.md
```

### 📝 KEY DECISIONS & RATIONALE

1. **Multi-field selection via checkboxes**
   - More discoverable than ctrl+click
   - Better for touch interfaces
   - Clear visual feedback

2. **Properties as drawer, not dropdown**
   - Complex forms need space
   - Persistent visibility required
   - Industry best practice

3. **Tables over charts for MVP**
   - Faster delivery
   - AG-Grid fully featured
   - Charts ready for Phase 2

### 🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Export Dialog Integration** (Critical)
   - Wire to toolbar Export button
   - Connect mock export generation

2. **Basic Scheduling** (Important)
   - Simple UI connection
   - Mock schedule creation

3. **Demo Scenarios** (Important)
   - 2-3 example reports
   - Screenshot documentation

4. **Phase 3 Planning** (Future)
   - Python microservices architecture
   - Real backend implementation

### 💻 COMMANDS TO RESUME

```bash
# Start application
cd /root/BOE
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f frontend

# Git status
git status
git log --oneline -n 5

# Test multi-field drag
# 1. Click checkboxes for multiple fields
# 2. Drag the blue "Drag X fields together" area
# 3. Drop on canvas to create table with all fields
```

### 🎭 COLLABORATION WITH GEMINI

**Successful Pattern**:
1. Present problem with context
2. Show proposed solutions
3. Ask for critical review
4. Challenge assumptions
5. Reach consensus before implementing

**Key Insights from Gemini**:
- Checkboxes > ctrl+click for multi-select
- Drawer > dropdown for property panels
- Batch operations need careful deduplication
- Performance not a concern for reasonable field counts

### 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (Acceptable for MVP)

1. Chart sections can be created but show as charts (not tables)
2. Export dialog exists but isn't wired to button
3. Schedule panel complete but doesn't save
4. No real authentication (mock only)
5. Text editor uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML

### 📚 DOCUMENTATION STATUS

All documentation updated to reflect:
- Table-focused MVP approach
- Multi-field drag-drop capability
- Properties panel as drawer
- Charts moved to Phase 2
- 85% completion status

### 🔑 KEY PATTERNS ESTABLISHED

#### Multi-Field Drag Pattern
```typescript
// Check for multiple fields
const isMultiple = dragData.isMultiple === true;
const fields = isMultiple ? dragData.multipleFields : [dragData as Field];

// Process all fields
fields.forEach(field => {
  // Add to appropriate dimension/measure
});
```

#### Properties Drawer Pattern
```typescript
<Drawer
  placement="right"
  width={400}
  open={propertiesDrawerOpen}
  onClose={() => setPropertiesDrawerOpen(false)}
>
  <PropertiesPanel />
</Drawer>
```

### ✅ SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS

1. Enhanced drag-drop from single to multi-field
2. Made critical UX decision on properties panel
3. Strategically reduced scope for faster delivery
4. Initialized GitHub repository
5. Updated all documentation
6. Maintained working application throughout

### 📌 FINAL NOTES

The BOE replacement system Phase 1 is nearly complete with a table-focused MVP approach. The multi-field drag-drop enhancement significantly improves usability. The Properties panel remains a drawer based on UX best practices. Charts are ready but deprioritized. The codebase is clean, documented, and version-controlled on GitHub.

**Ready for next session to complete remaining 15% and begin Phase 3 planning.**
