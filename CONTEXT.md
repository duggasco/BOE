# Context Carryover for Next Session

## Current Status: Phase 2 - 95% Complete (2025-08-07)

### Session Accomplishments

#### 1. Production-Quality Responsive Design (v0.23.0)
- ✅ Created ViewportProvider with centralized, debounced resize listener
- ✅ Eliminated performance issues from multiple resize listeners
- ✅ Single source of truth for breakpoints (768px mobile, 1024px tablet)
- ✅ Removed all duplicate resize listeners from components

#### 2. WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility
- ✅ Created comprehensive accessibility.css
- ✅ Focus indicators, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- ✅ Minimum touch targets (44x44px, 48x48 on mobile)
- ✅ High contrast mode and reduced motion support

#### 3. Loading States & Error Handling (After Gemini Collaboration)
- ✅ Created useAbortableRequest hook with AbortController
- ✅ Progressive loading delays (none: 0ms, fast: 100ms, network: 300ms)
- ✅ Composable skeleton components (TableSkeleton, CardSkeleton, etc.)
- ✅ ErrorBoundary with retry mechanisms
- ✅ EmptyStates with 12 predefined types
- ✅ Simplified LoadingState component accepting custom skeletons

#### 4. Gemini AI Collaboration Outcomes
**Critical Review Points Addressed:**
- Replaced isMountedRef anti-pattern with AbortController
- Made skeletons lighter (removed complex SVG animations)
- Kept execute wrapper but made it configurable
- Implemented progressive loading delays
- Two-level error boundaries approach agreed upon

### Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Agreement with Gemini:**
   - Keep custom skeletons but make them composable
   - Use useAbortableRequest hook for API calls
   - Progressive loading delays based on operation type
   - Two-level error boundaries (root + feature-specific)

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Single resize listener with 150ms debounce
   - Request caching in useAbortableRequest
   - Lighter skeleton animations
   - Optimized re-renders with centralized state

### Files Created/Modified This Session

#### New Files:
- `/contexts/ViewportContext.tsx` - Centralized viewport management
- `/hooks/useAbortableRequest.ts` - AbortController-based request hook
- `/components/common/LoadingStates/` - All skeleton components
- `/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundary implementation
- `/components/common/EmptyStates.tsx` - Empty state components
- `/styles/responsive.css` - Responsive design utilities
- `/styles/accessibility.css` - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance styles

#### Modified Files:
- `MainLayout.tsx` - Removed resize listener, uses ViewportProvider
- `ReportList.tsx` - Uses useAbortableRequest and new LoadingState
- `App.tsx` - Added ViewportProvider and ErrorBoundary wrappers

### Remaining Phase 2 Tasks

1. **Demo Preparation (5%)**
   - ✅ DEMO.md documentation created
   - ⏳ Interactive walkthrough implementation
   - ⏳ Video recordings needed

2. **Final Polish**
   - All loading states tested ✅
   - Error boundaries working ✅
   - Empty states implemented ✅
   - Accessibility verified ✅

### Critical Information for Next Session

#### Known Issues:
- None critical - all major issues resolved

#### Dependencies to Remember:
- Using Ant Design 5.x for UI components
- AG-Grid for data tables
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- TypeScript throughout

#### Architecture Patterns Established:
1. **ViewportProvider Pattern:**
```tsx
const { isMobile, isTablet } = useViewport();
```

2. **Request Pattern:**
```tsx
const { data, loading, error, retry } = useAbortableRequest(
  fetchFunction,
  dependencies,
  { loadingDelayType: 'network' }
);
```

3. **Loading State Pattern:**
```tsx
<LoadingState
  loading={loading}
  error={error}
  empty={isEmpty}
  skeleton={<CustomSkeleton />}
  onRetry={retry}
>
  {/* Content */}
</LoadingState>
```

### Phase 3 Planning Notes

**Backend Architecture (Agreed with Gemini):**
- Python microservices for heavy lifting
- Node.js BFF for API orchestration
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Redis for caching/queues
- Celery for scheduling

**Priority Order:**
1. Database setup and migrations
2. Python query service
3. Authentication service
4. Export engine
5. Scheduling service

### Collaboration Notes

**Working with Gemini:**
- Equal partnership established
- Critical review process working well
- Don't offload work - collaborate on solutions
- Challenge each other's assumptions
- Come to parity before implementing

**Testing Approach:**
- Always use Playwright MCP for UI testing
- Test at multiple breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1440px)
- Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Check loading states and error handling

### Commands and Scripts

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up

# Test frontend
./test-frontend.sh

# Access application
http://localhost:5173

# Check TypeScript
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

# Playwright testing via MCP
# Use mcp__playwright__ commands
```

### Environment State
- Docker containers running (frontend, postgres, redis)
- Frontend accessible at localhost:5173
- All Phase 2 features implemented and tested
- Ready for Phase 3 backend development

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete interactive walkthrough
2. Record demo videos
3. Final Phase 2 review
4. Begin Phase 3 backend setup
5. Create API contracts for frontend-backend integration
