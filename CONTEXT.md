# Context Carryover for Next Session

## Current Status: Phase 2.5 - COMPLETE (2025-08-08, v0.28.0)

### Latest Achievement: Native Deployment Support

#### Phase 2.5 Completion (v0.28.0)
Successfully implemented sophisticated deployment scripts that work without sudo or apt access:

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Intelligent Deployment Scripts**:
   - `start.sh`: Auto-detects Docker → Native Node.js → Local installation
   - `stop.sh`: Safe shutdown with process confirmation
   - Both scripts work entirely in user space (no sudo required)

2. **Security Improvements (Gemini AI Review)**:
   - Fixed destructive `rm -rf` without confirmation
   - Added NVM installation security warnings
   - Improved process detection to avoid killing unrelated processes
   - Docker operations now target only frontend service
   - Build failure detection in production mode

3. **Deployment Features**:
   - Can install Node.js locally to `$HOME/.local/node` if not available
   - Multiple tool fallbacks for maximum compatibility
   - Colorful, user-friendly output with clear error messages
   - Support for `--docker`, `--native`, and `--production` flags
   - PID file management for accurate process tracking

4. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Tested with Playwright MCP browser automation
   - Verified both Docker and native deployments work
   - Confirmed scripts work without sudo access
   - Hot reload verified in both modes

### Previous Accomplishments (Phase 2)

#### Export Dialog Fix (v0.27.0)
- Resolved conflicting ExportDialog components
- Export button now functional in Report Builder
- Docker setup simplified to single frontend container

#### Interactive Walkthrough (v0.26.x)
- React Joyride implementation with multi-page tours
- Fixed navigation issues with proper state management
- MutationObserver for reliable element detection

#### Admin Portal (100% Complete)
- Field Management Interface
- User Management (Users, Groups, Roles, Permissions)
- System Configuration (Data Sources, Settings, Feature Flags, Theme)
- Monitoring Dashboard (Schedule Monitor, System Metrics)
- Dark Mode Support
- WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility
- Responsive Design with ViewportProvider

### Deployment Scripts Overview

#### start.sh Capabilities:
```bash
# Auto-detection mode (default)
./start.sh

# Force specific deployment
./start.sh --docker      # Use Docker only
./start.sh --native      # Use native Node.js only
./start.sh --production  # Build and serve production

# Features:
- Detects Docker (including rootless)
- Checks Node.js version
- Can install Node.js locally without sudo
- Port conflict detection
- Dependency installation (npm ci if lock exists)
```

#### stop.sh Capabilities:
```bash
# Stop application
./stop.sh

# Features:
- Stops Docker containers (frontend only)
- Terminates native Node.js processes
- Uses PID file for accurate tracking
- Prompts before killing processes
- Optional log file cleanup
```

### Files Created/Modified This Session

#### New Files:
- `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification (v20)
- `frontend/.nvmrc` - Frontend-specific Node version
- `start.sh` - Intelligent deployment script (447 lines)
- `stop.sh` - Safe shutdown script (219 lines)

#### Updated Files:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.28.0 release notes
- `TODO.md` - Marked Phase 2.5 as complete
- `PLAN.md` - Updated Phase 2.5 status to complete
- `frontend/package.json` - Already had deployment scripts configured

### Critical Patterns & Best Practices

#### Deployment Without Sudo:
```bash
# Local Node.js installation pattern
NODE_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/node"
NODE_URL="https://nodejs.org/dist/v${VERSION}/node-v${VERSION}-${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
# Download, extract, and add to PATH
export PATH="$NODE_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Safe Process Management:
```bash
# Use PID files for tracking
echo $! > boe-frontend.pid

# Confirm before killing processes
echo -n "Would you like to stop these processes? (y/n): "
read -r response
```

#### Port Detection Fallbacks:
```bash
# Multiple methods for compatibility
netstat -tuln | grep ":$PORT"  # Traditional
ss -tuln | grep ":$PORT"        # Modern Linux
nc -z localhost $PORT           # Netcat
curl -s http://localhost:$PORT  # HTTP check
```

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Gemini AI Code Review Results:
- **Strengths**: Well-structured, excellent error handling, great UX
- **Critical Issues Fixed**: 
  - Destructive rm -rf without confirmation
  - Broad process killing patterns
  - Docker compose affecting all services
- **Security Improvements**: All implemented successfully

#### Playwright MCP Testing:
- ✅ Docker deployment tested and working
- ✅ Native Node.js deployment tested and working
- ✅ Stop/start cycles verified
- ✅ Port management confirmed
- ✅ Application accessible at http://localhost:5173

### Environment & Commands

```bash
# Quick Start Commands
./start.sh              # Auto-detect and start
./stop.sh               # Stop application
npm start               # From frontend/ directory
npm run start:docker    # Force Docker
npm run start:native    # Force native
npm run stop            # Stop from frontend/

# Docker Commands (if using Docker)
docker compose up -d frontend
docker compose stop frontend
docker logs -f boe-frontend

# Native Commands (if using Node.js)
cd frontend && npm run dev     # Development
cd frontend && npm run build   # Production build
cd frontend && npm run preview # Serve production
```

### Next Session Priorities

1. **Phase 3 Backend Development**:
   - Python microservices architecture
   - Scheduling Service (Celery + Redis)
   - Export Engine (pandas + openpyxl)
   - Query Service (SQLAlchemy)
   - Authentication Service (JWT + OAuth2)

2. **Remaining Minor Items**:
   - Update Dockerfile.dev for non-root user (deferred from Phase 2.5)
   - Create demo videos and presentations
   - Performance benchmarking (Docker vs Native)

3. **Integration Planning**:
   - Define API contracts
   - Design database schema
   - Plan authentication flow
   - Create data migration scripts

### Success Metrics

**Phase 2.5 Achievements:**
- ✅ No sudo required for deployment
- ✅ Works on systems without Docker
- ✅ Can install Node.js locally if needed
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Unix)
- ✅ Security best practices implemented
- ✅ User-friendly with clear feedback
- ✅ Production-ready deployment scripts

### Key Decisions & Learnings

1. **Shell Scripts vs Node.js**: Kept shell scripts per user preference (more portable)
2. **Security First**: All Gemini-identified issues addressed
3. **User Experience**: Colorful output, confirmations, clear errors
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Docker → Native → Local Install → Manual
5. **Testing Approach**: Playwright MCP for end-to-end validation

### Important Notes for Next Session

1. **Deployment is Production-Ready**: Scripts handle all edge cases
2. **No Blocking Issues**: All critical problems resolved
3. **Documentation Complete**: All .md files updated
4. **Git Ready**: Changes staged for commit
5. **Application Running**: Can be started with `./start.sh`
