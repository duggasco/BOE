### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /root/BOE
docker compose up -d frontend
```

### 2. Access the Application
Open browser to: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Login (Mock Authentication)
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
- Click "Login" to enter the application

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fund Performance Dashboard
**Goal**: Create a financial dashboard showing fund performance metrics

#### Step 1: Navigate to Report Builder
1. Click "Report Builder" in the sidebar
2. Click "New Report" button

#### Step 2: Add a Text Header
1. Click "Add Section" → "Text"
2. Click "Edit" in the text section
3. Enter:
```markdown
# Fund Performance Dashboard
## Q4 2024 Analysis

This dashboard provides **real-time insights** into fund performance metrics including:
- *Total Assets Under Management*
- *Monthly Returns*
- *Year-to-Date Performance*
```
4. Click "Save"

#### Step 3: Create a Data Table
1. Click "Add Section" → "Table"
2. From the Field Selector, expand "Fund Information"
3. Drag these fields to the table section:
   - Fund Name (dimension)
   - Fund Type (dimension)
   - Manager (dimension)
4. Expand "Performance Metrics"
5. Drag these fields:
   - Total Assets (measure)
   - 1 Month Return (measure)
   - YTD Return (measure)
6. Click "Run" to execute the query
7. Show the AG-Grid features:
   - Sort by clicking column headers
   - Filter using column filters
   - Resize columns by dragging borders

#### Step 4: Add a Chart Visualization
1. Click "Add Section" → "Chart"
2. Drag fields to the chart section:
   - Fund Type (dimension)
   - Total Assets (measure)
3. Click "Run" to generate the chart
4. Demonstrate chart configuration:
   - Change chart type (Line → Bar → Pie)
   - Show different chart options
   - Note the responsive sizing

#### Step 5: Export Configuration
1. Click "Export" button
2. Walk through the Export Dialog tabs:
   - **Format Tab**: Choose Excel, show options
   - **Destination Tab**: Configure email delivery
   - **Schedule Tab**: Set up daily 9 AM delivery
   - **Prompts Tab**: Set date range parameters
3. Click "Schedule Export" to demonstrate

### Scenario 2: Top Performers Report
**Goal**: Identify top-performing funds with filtering

#### Step 1: Create Filtered Table
1. Start new report or add section
2. Add table section with:
   - Fund Name
   - 1 Year Return
   - Total Assets
3. In Properties Panel (right side):
   - Add filter: 1 Year Return > 10%
   - Sort by: 1 Year Return (Descending)
4. Run the report

#### Step 2: Add Pie Chart
1. Add chart section
2. Configure as pie chart showing:
   - Fund Type distribution
   - Total Assets by type
3. Note the "Top 10 + Others" aggregation

### Scenario 3: Container Layouts (Preview)
**Goal**: Show nested section capabilities

1. Click "Add Section" → "Container"
2. Show the container placeholder
3. Explain Phase 3 will enable:
   - Nested sections
   - Complex layouts
   - Section dependencies

## 🎨 Key Features to Highlight

### 1. Drag & Drop Interface
- Intuitive field selection
- Visual feedback during drag
- Smart field categorization (dimensions vs measures)

### 2. Professional UI/UX
- Responsive design
- Collapsible sidebar
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Ant Design components

### 3. Real-Time Query Execution
- Instant results with mock data
- Performance metrics displayed
- 5-year historical data available

### 4. Export & Distribution
- Multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Various destinations (Email, SFTP, Filesystem)
- Comprehensive scheduling options
- Report prompts/parameters

### 5. Chart Visualizations
- Multiple chart types
- Live configuration
- Business Objects color palette
- Metadata-driven formatting

### 6. State Management
- Undo/Redo functionality (50-step history)
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Report versioning

## 📈 Performance Metrics

During the demo, highlight:
- **Zero external dependencies** for core functionality
- **Docker containerized** for easy deployment
- **Fast hot-reload** development experience
- **Lightweight bundle** size
- **Mock data generation** for 100+ funds

## 🔄 Phase 1 → Phase 3 Transition

Explain the roadmap:

### Phase 1 (Current - Complete)
✅ Frontend with mock data
✅ All UI components functional
✅ Export/scheduling interface
✅ Chart visualizations
✅ Text sections

### Phase 3 (Next)
- Python microservices backend
- Real database connections
- Scheduling engine (Bull/Redis)
- Export generation (pandas/openpyxl)
- User authentication
- Drill-down capabilities

## 💡 Demo Tips

1. **Start with simple examples** - Don't overwhelm with complexity
2. **Show the speed** - Emphasize instant feedback
3. **Highlight containerization** - Everything runs in Docker
4. **Compare to Business Objects** - Show feature parity
5. **Mention scalability** - Microservices architecture ready

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

Be transparent about current limitations:
- Mock data only (no real database)
- Export doesn't generate actual files
- Scheduling doesn't persist
- Container sections are placeholders
- No user authentication (mock only)

## 📝 Closing Points

1. **100% Feature Coverage** planned for Business Objects core functionality
2. **Modern Tech Stack** - React, TypeScript, Python
3. **Cloud-Ready** - Containerized from day one
4. **Open Architecture** - Easy to extend and customize
5. **Performance First** - Optimized for large datasets
